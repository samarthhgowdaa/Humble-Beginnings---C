Need two things before I start to code in C:
1. **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)
2. *C* **Compiler**

We use an **IDE** to Write or edit our code, for this I choose **VS Code**

A *compiler* converts the written code to **machine code** (which is in Binary or something)

**Extensions Used:**
1. Name: C/C++ Extension Pack
